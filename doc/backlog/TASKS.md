## Postponed Items

### Profile System
- [ ] Support multiple profile search directories in priority order

### Network Tooling
- [ ] Replace the placeholder `get_network_stats` implementation in `src/network/stats.rs` with real parsing of `ip -s link show` output
- [ ] Add tests for network statistics parsing so byte and packet counters are validated from sample command output
- [ ] Remove the hard-coded `eth0` parent from `setup_network_isolation` in `src/network/firewall.rs` and make the uplink/interface configurable
- [ ] Expand the CLI network commands beyond bridge creation so the existing network helper functionality is reachable from the CLI
