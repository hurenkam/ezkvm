# Project Context

- **Owner:** Mark Hurenkamp
- **Project:** ezkvm_v3 redesign for import-source-agnostic VM runtime translation
- **Stack:** Rust, Cargo, YAML schema, QEMU/KVM machine modeling on Linux
- **Created:** 2026-05-28

## Learnings

- Day 1 context: product intent is drop-in Proxmox-origin VM execution on non-Proxmox Linux hosts.
- Canonical machine layout is the fixed model between import and runtime stages.
- Q35 and i440fx domain constraints are key to compatibility and deterministic behavior.
